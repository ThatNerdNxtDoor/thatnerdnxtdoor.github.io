                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    A recent graduate from Eastern Kentucky University, I got into computer science from a young age 
                    through the desire of becoming a video game developer. As such, I have focused most of my efforts into 
                    Interactive Multimedia and Software Development. I worked as a peer tutor for the Computer Science 
                    Department at EKU, and I have been in the position of President of the EKU Game & Dev Club. I have spoken
                    to and shared my ideas and thought processes in the realm of Software Development with a multitude of 
                    my peers throughout of time at college.

                    <p>
                        I helped guide students in the right direction with their coursework by explaining various concepts 
                        around programming and computational logic. While I primarily helped students in low-level classes, I was also 
                        capable of assisting students in more advanced classes like Database Systems and Graphics Programming.

                    <h3>Boil n' Bubble</h3>
                    <p>
                        A long term game development project that was originally a capstone project with
                        two other students, in which i was the primary programmer and project lead. After the 
                        capstone class, I have continued to work on the game independently. Boil n' Bubble is a 3D 
                        Alchemy Exploration game in which you explore a newly found wilderness and discover 
                        various ingredients and their uses through your own testing and experimentation. The 
                        game is made in the Godot Engine, using python as its primary language. Other exernal 
                        programs include Blender and Aseprite.

                    <h3>Calendar Management System</h3>
                    <p>
                        A project for my Ethics and Software Engineering class, I collaborated with 
                        two other students to create a Calendar and Meeting Management System, in which 
                        an employee in the system can define their availability, and a manager can schedule
                        meetings using their employees' availability. This project was made using C#, the 
                        .NET framework, and MySQL. My contributions to the project include interface design, 
                        navigating the client-side program, and contacting a school-owned database to verify 
                        login information.
